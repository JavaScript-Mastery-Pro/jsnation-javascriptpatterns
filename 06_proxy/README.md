### 1. Approach using Function with Caching

**Pros:**

- Simple implementation, easy to understand.
- No need for additional class definitions.
- Caching logic directly embedded within the function.

**Cons:**

- Global cache object may lead to potential conflicts or unintended side effects in larger applications.
- Lack of encapsulation; cache object is exposed and accessible from anywhere in the code.
- Limited reusability; the caching behavior is tightly coupled with the `fetchDataWithCache` function.

### 2. Approach using Class-based Proxy

**Pros:**

- **Encapsulation:** Cache logic is encapsulated within the `CacheProxy` class, promoting modularity and separation of concerns.
- **Clear separation of responsibilities:** `CacheProxy` handles caching, while `DataService` focuses on fetching data.
- **Flexibility:** Easily extendable with additional functionality or different caching strategies.

**Cons:**

- Requires defining and instantiating additional classes, potentially introducing overhead in simpler scenarios.
- More complex compared to a simple function-based approach.
- May not be as familiar to developers who are less experienced with object-oriented programming concepts.

### 3. Approach using Function with Closure

**Pros:**

- **Encapsulation:** Cache logic is encapsulated within the closure returned by `createCacheProxy`, similar to the class-based approach.
- Cleaner separation of concerns compared to the global cache object in Approach 1.
- Promotes functional programming principles.

**Cons:**

- Slightly more complex than Approach 1 due to the use of closures and higher-order functions.
- May be less familiar to developers primarily experienced with imperative or object-oriented paradigms.
- Lack of explicit class definitions may lead to less discoverability in larger codebases.

### Which is Better

Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the project.

- If simplicity and straightforwardness are prioritized, **Approach 1** would be suitable.
- If object-oriented principles and flexibility for extension are important, **Approach 2** is a good choice.
- If you prefer a functional approach with encapsulation and flexibility, **Approach 3** provides a balance between simplicity and separation of concerns.

In general, **Approach 2** might be preferable for larger applications where object-oriented design patterns are more familiar and applicable. However, **Approach 3** offers a good compromise between simplicity and flexibility, making it suitable for a wide range of scenarios.
